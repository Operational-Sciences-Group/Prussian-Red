# Prussian-Red

Prussian Red is a Python 3 random word generator to enhance your orginization's OPSEC.

Prussian Red generates random prefix, root, and suffix words.

This program is inspired by Ed Snowden's book Permanent Record towards the end of chapter 16
"It's basically an I Ching stochastic procedure that randomly picks words from two columns."

There's only 1 rule for naming ops:

The name of the op can't coorlate to the op itself.
