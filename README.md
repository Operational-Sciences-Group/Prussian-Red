# Prussian-Red

Prussian Red is a random name generator.

This program is inspired by Ed Snowden's book Permanent Record towards the end of chapter 16
"It's basically an I Ching stochastic procedure that randomly picks words from two columns."

There's only 1 rule for naming ops:

The name of the op can't coorlate to the op itself.


Prussian Red is a tool to enhance your orginization's OPSEC.
