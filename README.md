## About
Prussian Red generates random prefix, root, and suffix words.
It can generate more than 1 million unique project names!
Its creation was inspired by Ed Snowden's book *Permanent Record*<sup>1</sup>:

>"The NSA has a whole protocol you’re supposed to follow when you give a
>program a code name. It’s basically an I Ching–like stochastic procedure that
>randomly picks words from two columns. An internal website throws imaginary
>dice to pick one name from column A, and throws again to pick one name from
>column B. This is how you end up with names that don’t mean anything, like
>FOXACID and EGOTISTICALGIRAFFE. The point of a code name is that it’s
>not supposed to refer to what the program does."

## Installation/Usage
